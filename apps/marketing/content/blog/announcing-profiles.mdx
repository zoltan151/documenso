## Introducing Documenso Profiles

Today, Iâ€™m excited to announce that we are launching Documenso Profiles ðŸŽ‰ While we have been focussing on the conventional signing experience so far, Direct Links and now profiles are our first steps to bring some long-awaited innovation back to digital signatures.

Documenso Profiles allows you to share any template with a public link in a very easy-to-understand way. Adding templates to your profiles allows everyone to sign your documents just when they need to. Forms, NDAs, Disclaimers, and even contracts are now available anytime they are needed. Profiles turn the classic signing flow on its head by letting the recipient sign first before the documentâ€™s owner becomes active. Booking links (e.g., Cal.com) and customer self-service portals (e.g., Stripe Billing Portal) are becoming the norm, so itâ€™s time we did the same for signing.

## The Best Way to Share Your Singing Links

With profiles, we want to offer you the best way to share your standing Documenso Template Links in a public place. You can add your Documenso Profile to your social profiles, Email footer, Video Description, or wherever your audience, customers, and partners interact with you. The profile will be a public, trusted place to ensure you know who you are dealing with.

Looking at the classical social media fake profile problem, we know this is tricky to achieve. We will pay close attention to how profiles are used and how we can help the community use them easily and securely. As a first step towards this direction, we are introducing a trust badge next to your name. There will be 3 levels to start:

- Free Users: No Badge
- Paid Users: Green Badge
- Early Adopters: Gold Badge

## An Open Economy built on Documenso

We see offering profiles as a first step towards creating a full economy on top of the open signing ecosystem we envision. While we want to keep building the product with the community, we also want an economy to grow on the open tech we create. This includes using the tech (profiles) or offering service on top of the tech (hosting and customization). Our ecosystem is still young, and the goal is not to have Documenso Inc. as the only commercial actor but to fill our own niche in a global and thriving open ecosystem. One of our guiding principles is solving things once and for all. While our focus will be on the core signing product, we want to enable others to offer templates for use on profiles or privately. A lot of contracts, forms, and other paperwork have been recreated countless times. Offering high-quality, peer-reviewed templates is a natural extension of the current platform. There will be free templates, offered as marketing for their creators, and paid templates, offered as actual products.

## What's next

While an open signing economy is really exciting, we know it will take time to mature. Building out a mature ecosystem for builders and entrepreneurs takes time. While this aspect of Documenso matures, we will be focussing on the core of the platform: Letting you integrate and embed Documenso wherever you want it.
