> TLDR; Set up notifications using Zapier, use a redirect to send users to the next step, and start working async with direct links.

Signing all the paperwork of a freelance business can be a headache. Besides adding to the daily workload, it can pull much focus from your core tasks. Let's take a look at how Documenso can help you keep the cognitive load of admin tasks to a minimum:

## Tip 1: Set Up Notifications

> At Documenso, we pipe almost everything relevant into Discord. This helps us naturally keep track and start conversations.

Getting customers and partners to sign off on critical agreements is no easy feat. It's even harder when keeping track forces you to switch between channels (email, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, Notion, etc.). Setting up custom notifications for read or signed documents can help you keep track naturally. Using the Documenso [Zapier Integration](https://documen.so/zapier) lets you funnel important document events to the place where your focus is. Pipe send, read, and sign notifications directly to your Telegram account. Keep up to date on the go. Sync document completion events to your CRM. Ideally, a signed document does not give you any "homework”. Besides, you are already busy getting started on the actual work.

## Tip 2: Use Redirects

Your client signed the deal? Your designer signed their statement of work? Great. Don't risk losing steam getting from one step to the next. Your customers and partners have just as much noise around them as you. Help them to stay on task by doing the next thing easily. Documenso lets you set up redirects to send signers to where they need to go next. Send your newest customer to a booking page for onboarding. Forward your designer to the next briefing you prepared. Keeping up flow is critical; sending everyone where they need to go while in focus mode helps get things done faster.

## Tip 3: Go Async with Direct Links

> Try Direct Links by signing our [Supporters Pledge](https://documen.so/pledge)

Your customer wanting to approve an additional budget is great. It’s so great. In fact, you want to get on it as soon as possible and not have a calm moment until you send them something to sign. Even if you are fast, you are not mind-ready, though. So, what if your customers could do it whenever they like?

Direct Links lets you set up proposal templates and contracts, which are ready to sign anytime. You can include them in your [initial proposal](https://documen.so/freelance-proposal) or on your [public profile](https://documen.so/profiles). This way, customers can get more of your offering whenever they want.

## Conclusion

Setting up notifications, redirects, and direct signing links using your favorite open source DocuSign alternative helps streamline your business and reduce the cognitive load of managing it. You can get everything mentioned here plus 5 free monthly signatures in the [Documenso Free Plan](https://documen.so/free).
