## Yes to Yes

> [Check out Part 1](https://documen.so/freelance-proposal) to learn about signing freelance proposals with Documenso and getting your first yes

A basic rule of sales is going from "yes to yes‚Äù. Outlining the main points of working together in a proposal is a good way to get to your first yes since it reduces details and focuses on the main points of the work at hand. After being on the same page about the work and getting the first yes, it's time to draw up a formal contract. While agreeing to the proposal has some weight as well, the legal contract formalizes the commitments of both sides in an enforceable way. Having clear legal terms on payments, unexpected cases, and even dissolving the partnership helps both parties to feel assured about what to expect.

### **Digital Signatures for the Win**

Digitally signing documents accelerates contract closure, enhancing both speed and security. Parties can review and sign documents within minutes, eliminating the days required for manual signatures or even weeks with traditional mail. Beyond these efficiency gains, digital signatures boost trust by making the process secure and auditable. Once signed, digital documents are immutable, and every step is logged.

Documenso simplifies this process, allowing you to send contracts effortlessly. As an open-source solution, our product's integrity and security are verifiable by anyone, which is why thousands of users rely on Documenso for their signing needs.

## Preparing the Contract

As a freelancer, obtaining a contract template ensures you have a standardized and professional agreement ready for new clients, helping to protect your interests and clarify project terms. While there are many good templates out there, be sure to verify that they fit your case since contracts are often very specific to a certain case. Always consider having your contract checked by a legal professional if it's a high-value transaction.

Here is a quick checklist of what your contract should include:

### Checklist

- Names and Addresses of you and your client
- Scope of Work to be performed, deadlines and deliverables
- Payment Terms, Payment Schedules, and Pricing
- A clear timeline
- Provisions for unexpected extra work
- Intellectual Property Rights Provisions
- Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreements, if needed
- Termination Clauses: Condition and terms when the contract can be terminated, including notice period and compensation
- Indemnity and Liability
- Dispute Resolution
- Provisions ensuring changes can only be made in writing
- Completeness Agreement: Both parties state this is the full extent of the agreement
- Severability Clause ensuring minor errors will not endanger the whole contract
- The signees with name, role, and date

## Getting the Signature

Once you have your contract ready, you can upload it and add recipients and signature fields. To add a more personal touch, consider adding a personal message to the signature request.

You can also copy the link for each recipient after sending it and send it via another channel e.g. WhatsApp with a personal message. To further customize the experience, you can define a redirect when your customer signs the contract to redirect them to a Cal.com Link to get started, a Thank You Page, or a Form.
