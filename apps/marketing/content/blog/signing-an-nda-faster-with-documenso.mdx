## What is an NDA?

An NDA, or non-disclosure agreement, is a legal contract that establishes a confidential relationship. The parties involved agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement. NDAs are often used to protect sensitive information or trade secrets and to ensure that such information isn't made public by the recipient without permission. They are commonly used in business settings, such as during negotiations or when new employees are hired who will have access to proprietary information.

## Do I need an NDA?

> Disclaimer: This is not legal advice, and the most important legal questions are often ultra-case-specific and should be discussed with a legal professional

There is a solid amount of debate around the question of whether an NDA actually protects anyone and is worth the friction. Investors scoff at the idea of a startup requiring them to sign an NDA before disclosing their "billion dollar idea" as they see hundreds of them and are aware that without proper execution, there is nothing to protect.

In another classical example, a big company and a small company e.g. a startup, sign an NDA before going into detail for partnership talks. While this seems prudent, given the resource asymmetry, the startup probably won't be able to litigate against breach of contract successfully. If Microsoft (not saying they do) breaks your NDA, you will hardly sue them into a settlement.

That being said, as with most contracts, NDAs can be useful if both parties keep the spirit of the agreement. In this case, detailing in writing what can and cannot be disclosed is good for managing expectations and building trust. NDAs are also common practice in merger and acquisition projects and are often part of hiring critical roles within a company.

### Level 1: Basic Signing

If you need to sign an NDA, signing it with Documenso is incredibly fast already. Let's take a look at how to make it even faster. Simply uploading and sending is the most straightforward way to get this done. It works like this:

- Upload the NDA PDF template
- Add the recipients
- place the signature fields
- Hit send
- Sign the NDA while or after waiting for your counterpart to sign

### Level 2: Using Templates

If you have to sign the same NDA multiple times with different people, you can create a template to save time. Creating a template is just as easy as creating a document, just skipping the sending step. After creating the template for your NDA, you can create a signable document with just 1 click. Simply fill in the recipient email, and you are done.

> Pro Tip: Check "Send Document" to immediately send it after filling out the recipient if you are familiar with the template.

### Level 3: Using a Direct Link

Using a pre-defined template is pretty fast, but can we make it even faster? Yes, we can! By adding a direct link to your NDA template and publishing it (internally or even externally). A [Direct Link](http://documenso.com/blog/announcing-direct-links) lets people sign your NDA without you lifting a finger. Everyone with access to the link can sign it at any time, making discussions of who sends what when a thing of the past. You can use Direct links with a pre-signed template for maximum convenience or with a second signer/ approver from your side to keep control over the process.

You can try it here and [sign a demo NDA](https://documen.so/demo-nda) with me.

> Pro Tip: Use [Zapier](https://documen.so/zapier) to get notified of that platform of your choice as soon as someone signs your link.

## Conclusion

Signing NDAs is not always effective, but it can be necessary, so be sure to use a tool to make it easy and fast. Documenso is a great DocuSign alternative that helps you get it done. If you need to get an NDA out today, you can use the [Documenso Free plan](https://documen.so/free), which gives you 5 signatures per month and 3 Direct Link templates.
