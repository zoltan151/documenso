> TLDR; The Early Adopters Plan ended, and we have a new pricing. If you are an Early Adopter, reach out for a Discord community badge üèÖ

# The End of the Beginning

12 months, 13 releases, and 344 merged pull requests after announcing the Early Adopter plan in our first-ever launch week, and we hit the cap of 100. Documenso has changed and grown a lot since then. For us, this is a great milestone towards our broader mission of bringing open signing to the world since now we are joined by a community consisting of contributors and early customers all around the world.

# The New Plans

Starting today, we are sunsetting the Early Adopter Plan in favor of our new, more nuanced pricing model. The Early Adopter plan will succeeded by the **Individual plan**, which is still priced at $30/mo. The Individual plans will still include unlimited signatures and recipients since this aligns with our core belief of empowering our users wherever possible. If you managed to grab an Early Adopter plan, reach out on X or Discord to receive a special community badge. Early Adopters are meant to get preferential treatment where possible.

Previously soft-launched as part of Early Adopters, we are officially introducing the **Team Plan** to our pricing for customers requiring multi-user accounts. Priced at $50/ mo. for 5 users, this plan offers unlimited signature volume as well. Additional users can be added for $10/mo. as needed. We have carefully crafted the billing of teams to ensure that dynamic changes are accurately reflected at the end of each billing cycle, providing you with a fair-value pricing structure.

Our **Free Plan** stays unchanged, offering coverage to casual users and an easy way to try out Documenso or start developing.

Check out our [new pricing page here](https://documen.so/pricing). We also updated our [open page](https://documen.so/open) to reflect the end of Early Adopters. The metric now counts active subscriptions from Individuals and Teams.

# API Access

All plans include access to the API as per our philosophy, making Documenso an open platform, and allowing everyone to build on it, no matter how big or small. Besides the Free Plan's 5 signatures per month limit, the API does not have access restrictions. Even the free plan can keep using the API after using its signature volume for non-signing operations like reading, editing, and even creating documents. Since the individual plan technically allows for running a Fortune 500 company for $30/ mo., plan we are adding a fair use clause here: You are free to use the API "a lot" if you are a big organization trying to stay on the Individual Plan we will ask to have a word about upgrading (which might make sense anyway considering your requirements). Fair use excludes Early Adopters, which we consider limitless by any measure. If you need clarification on whether your case is covered under fair use, you can contact us on Discord or support@documenso.com. It's probably fine, though.

We also have a lot in the pipeline, and we are excited to share everything with you soon. A Big Shoutout to all Early Adopters. We salute you, and you will receive the preferred treatment where possible.

If you have any questions or comments, please reach out on [Twitter / X](https://twitter.com/eltimuro) (DM open) or [Discord](https://documen.so/discord).
