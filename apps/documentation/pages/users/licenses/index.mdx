# Self-Hosting Licenses

Documenso comes in two versions for self-hosting:

### [Community Edition (Free)](licenses/community-edition)

- Free
- No official support

### [Enterprise Edition (Paid)](licenses/enterprise-edition)

- Paid
- Official support
- Enterprise Features

The choice between the two editions is entirely yours, depending on your specific needs. If you require official support and enterprise-level compliance, the Enterprise Edition is likely the best fit. However, if you find that the Community Edition, with its almost unrestricted features and use cases (including commercial use), meets all your requirements, we encourage you to start with it. Remember, you can always upgrade later.
