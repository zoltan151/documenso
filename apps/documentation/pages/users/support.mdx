# Support

## Community Support

If you are a developer or free user, you can reach out to the community or raise an issue:

### [Create Github Issues](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/issues)

The community and the core team address GitHub issues. Be sure to check if a similar issue already exists. Please note that while we want to address everything immediately, we must prioritize.

### [Join our Discord](https://documen.so/discord)

You can ask for help in the [community help channel](https://discord.com/channels/1132216843537485854/1133419426524430376).
