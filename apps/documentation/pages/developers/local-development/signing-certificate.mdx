# Create Your Signing Certificate

Digitally signing documents requires a signing certificate in `.p12` format. You can either purchase one or create a free self-signed certificate.

Follow the steps below to create a free, self-signed certificate for local development.

<Steps>

### Generate Private Key

Generate a private key using OpenSSL by running the following command:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
```

This command generates a 2048-bit RSA key.

### Generate Self-Signed Certificate

Using the private key, generate a self-signed certificate by running the following command:

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -key private.key -out certificate.crt -days 365
```

You will be prompted to enter some information, such as the certificate's Common Name (CN). Ensure that you provide the correct details. The `â€”days` parameter specifies the certificate's validity period.

### Create `p12` Certificate

Combine the private key and the self-signed certificate to create a `.p12` certificate. Use the following command:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.p12 -inkey private.key -in certificate.crt
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you get the error "Error: Failed to get private key bags", add the `-legacy` flag to the command `openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.p12 -inkey private.key -in certificate.crt -legacy`.

</Callout>

### `p12` Certificate Password

When you create the `.p12` certificate, you will be prompted to enter a password. Enter a strong password and keep it secure. Remember this password, as it will be required when using the certificate.

Note that for local development, the password can be left empty.

### Add Certificate to the Project

Finally, add the certificate to the project. Place the `certificate.p12` file in the `/apps/web/resources` directory. If the directory doesn't exist, create it.

The final file path should be `/apps/web/resources/certificate.p12`.

</Steps>
