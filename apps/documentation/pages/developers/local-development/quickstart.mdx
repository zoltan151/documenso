# Developer Quickstart

<Callout type="info">
  **Note**: This guide assumes that you have both [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
  [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your machine.
</Callout>

Want to get up and running quickly? Follow these steps:

<Steps>

### Fork Documenso

Fork the [Documenso repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) to your GitHub account.

### Clone Repository

After forking the repository, clone it to your local device by using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/documenso
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Set up your environment variables in the `.env` file using the `.env.example` file as a reference.

Alternatively, you can run `cp .env.example .env` to get started with our handpicked defaults.

### Start Database and Mail Server

Run `npm run dx` in the root directory.

This will spin up a Postgres database and inbucket mailserver in a docker container.

### Start the Application

Run `npm run dev` in the root directory to start the application.

### (Optional) Fasten the Process

Want it even faster? Just use:

```sh
npm run d
