# Manual Setup

Follow these steps to set up Documenso on your local machine:

<Steps>

### Fork Documenso

Fork the [Documenso repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) to your GitHub account.

### Clone Repository

After forking the repository, clone it to your local device by using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/documenso
```

### Install Dependencies

Run `npm i` in the root directory to install the dependencies required for the project.

### Set Up Environment Variables

Set up the following environment variables in the `.env` file:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL

```

Alternatively, you can run `cp .env.example .env` to get started with our handpicked defaults.
